I really hate long bug templates that feel like you're in a bureaucratic nightmare, so simply use your best judgment about what could be helpful in diagnosing the issue you're seeing, and we'll work the rest out together.

Below are a few ideas of things to include:
- Description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce the behavior
- The expected behavior
- Any relevant error messages
- Neovim version
- Your Yop configuration
- Debug output from Yop (use `require("yop").setup({debug_level = 2])` to get relevant debug information
